# Vegetarian Recipe Seeker App

## Project Overview
The Vegetarian Recipe Seeker App is designed for convenience, allowing users to quickly find recipes without the hassle of long video browsing. With 86 million consumers spending an average of 25 minutes on food websites, the app offers a faster alternative by displaying recipes quickly. It prioritizes safety by showing allergens and warnings before viewing recipes, ensuring users can cook with confidence and avoid potential risks. Additionally, with 44% of Americans meal prepping regularly, the app allows users to store all their favorite recipes in one place, making meal planning faster, safer, and more organized.

## Project Plan

### Completed Till Now
- **Login and Signup Page**: Implemented user authentication, allowing users to log in with preset credentials (username: `user`, password: `1234`).
- **Home Screen**: Created the home screen with a drawer layout and a list of dishes, allowing navigation to different sections of the app.
- **Search Activity**: Implemented a search feature to find recipes quickly, displaying a list of dishes with filtering capabilities.
- **Recipe Details Page**: Developed the `RecipeDetailActivity` to show detailed information for selected recipes, particularly for one dish, with specific ingredients and instructions.
- **Favorite Feature**: Integrated functionality to allow users to mark recipes as favorites, with persistent storage using `SharedPreferences`.
- **Navigation Bar**: Set up a side navigation bar for easy access to different parts of the app.

### Still Has to Be Implemented
- **User Registration**: Extend the login functionality to include user registration for new accounts.
- **Dynamic Recipe Data**: Fetch recipe data dynamically from a database or API instead of hardcoding, enabling a broader range of recipes.
- **Allergen and Warning Notifications**: Implement a system to display allergens and warnings associated with each recipe prior to viewing.
- **User Interface Enhancements**: Improve the overall UI/UX for a more engaging experience, focusing on design elements and usability.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Conduct thorough testing to identify and resolve any bugs or usability issues across all screens.
- **Additional Recipe Details**: Expand the `RecipeDetailActivity` to include details for recipes other than that one dish ensuring all recipes have ingredient and instruction information.
